# ðŸ”¥âš  HOTFIX

For those suddenly getting network issues, you can replace the ip address with the right one
in your hosts file.

1. `ping ggst-game.guiltygear.com`. Note the IP address:

```
Pinging ggst-game.guiltygear.com [<ip addr>] with 32 bytes of data:
```

3. Run notepad as administrator
4. Change the line with `ggst-game-real.guiltygear.com`. Note the **`real`**

```
# C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
<ip addr> ggst-game-real.guiltygear.com
```


    



## tl;dr

`gg-struggle` is a program that reduces loading times by caching
the Guilty Gear server responses. Instead of taking 500+ ms/request,
this takes ~20ms/req.

Download [here](https://github.com/tsaibermelon/gg-struggle/releases/download/v1.4.1/install-gg-struggle-v1.4.1.exe)

### Usage

1. Install using `install-gg-struggle.exe`.
2. Start `gg-struggle`. Keep this console open while guilty gear is running.
3. _SLASH!_

## Overview

`gg-struggle` is a local webserver that caches responses from the guilty
This speeds up loading and menu times for regions furthest from Japan (NA, EU)

I'll update this with more documentation as I have time

### Automated Install

Install using the `install-gg-struggle.exe` installer.

1. run `install-gg-struggle.exe`
2. Launch `gg-struggle.exe` through the start menu
3. Load game

NOTE: While installed, `gg-struggle` MUST be running while the game is up.
You must uninstall to revert things to normal.

### Manual Install

1. Run `certmgr.exe` as admin
2. Import `gg-struggle-cert.pem` under the **"Trusted Root Certification Authority"**
3. Edit `c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` file as admin to include the following lines

    127.0.0.1 ggst-game.guiltygear.com
    3.112.119.46 ggst-game-real.guiltygear.com

## How It Works

### Problem

When loading up the main menu, the guilty gear game downloads all your game
data in several HTTP (100+) requests to the game servers. These requests
are done in order, waiting for one to complete before doing the next.

Making this many requests isn't too bad, until you factor in latency.
Each request has to go to Japan and back, ~250ms each way / ~500+ ms total.
Multiply this by 100 requests and no wonder it can take it 5 minutes.

A good explanation of this can be found on reddit: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/oaqwo5/analysis_of_network_traffic_at_game_startup)

### Solution

tl;dr cache the responses and send old ones back to the game immediately.

To solve this we put a fake server (`gg-struggle`) in the middle, between the game and the server.
We trick our game into thinking `gg-struggle` is the real server and asks
it for data. `gg-struggle` makes the same request to the real server and copies the response
back to the game. Then saves the response for later.

The next time the game tries to make the same request (e.g. download latest news),
`gg-struggle` will already have saved that data from earlier and return it back
immediately.

## Known Issues

> slow first load

The first load is always gonna be slow as normal, but subsequent loads should be faster.

> Floor lockout / old data

As of 1.3, any changes to player data won't show in the client for 24 hours.
Future versions will dynamically cache data based on the request routes,
so that trivial data like player lobbies are always up-to-date.

This'll be fixed in the next patch.

## Logs

Windows: `%TEMP%/gg-struggle/all.log`
linux: `$TMPDIR/gg-struggle/all.log`

## FAQ

> Is this a virus? How safe is this? Will I get banned?

This is 100% safe. No game files or packets are tampered with,
and the executable running is just a common webserver like apache or nginx.

The HTTP requests that are cached are forwarded raw from the
game to the real gg server. There's no way to distinguish if the HTTP
request was made from the proxy or the game.

> What does the installation do?

The installation does 3 things

1. Installs the .exe file
2. Modifies the `hosts` file
3. Locally generates a Self-Signed Certificate
  - installs to the windows root store
  - copy stored at `%ProgramFiles%/gg-struggle`

> Is this a private server?

This is NOT a private server. This is a cache that your game downloads from
the server.

> Where is my data stored/sent?

Data is never sent anywhere besides your computer and the real
servers. All the magic happens locally.

The HTTP response/request payloads are stored in your temp directory,
`%TEMP%/gg-struggle/dumps`. Request data can be viewed as a sqlite3
database in `%TEMP%/gg-struggle/gg-struggle.db`.

> Does this affect gameplay at all?

Nope. The gameplay itself doesn't deal with this HTTP api endpoint
to coordinate gameplay. This only affects out-of-game stuff like menus.

## Removal

**! FAILSAFE !**

If everything goes wrong, **edit the hosts file to remove any line that
says `ggst-game.guiltygear.com`**. You must restart the game afterwards.

You should also remove the `gg-struggle` certificate by

1. Run `certmgr.msc` as admin
2. Navigate to "Trusted Root Certifcation Authorities"
3. Delete `gg-struggle`
